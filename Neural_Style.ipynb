    "\n",
    "The Neural-Style, or Neural-Transfert, is an algorithm that taks as input a content-image (e.g. a tortle), a style-image (e.g. artistic waves) and return the content of the content-image as if it was 'painted' using the artistic style of the style-image:\n",

    "\n",
    "### How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The principe is simple: we define two distances, one for the content ($D_c$) and one for the style ($D_s$). $D_c$ measues how different is the content between two images, while $D_s$ measures how different is the style between two images. Then, we just try to minimise those two distances. \n",
    "\n",
    "### OK. How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, going further requires some mathematics. Let $C_{nn}$ be a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network and $X$ be any image. $C_{nn}(X)$ is the network feed by $X$ (containing feature maps at all layers). Let $F_X^L \\in C_{nn}(X)$ be the feature map at depth layer $L$. \n",
